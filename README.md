## **View and edit css variables with color decorators (HSL and HSLA only)**

## Usages

![Usages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meouwu-dev/css-var-color-decorator/master/assets/feature-1.gif)

## Features

When using tailwindcss css variables, 
we must exclude the color space function or opacity modifiers won't work 
[(ref)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables). 
However, this makes it difficult to see what color a variable is set to. 

This extension adds color decorators to those variables, so you can see and edit them easily.

## Limitations

- only works with HSL and HSLA (need to figure out how to find the format of the variable, and covert it back after picking a color in the decorator)

## TODO

[ ] add support for other color formats
